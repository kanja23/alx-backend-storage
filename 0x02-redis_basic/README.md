## Installation

To use Redis, you need to install it on your system. Follow these instructions to install Redis:

1. Visit the official [Redis download page](https://redis.io/download).
2. Choose the appropriate download option based on your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions for your specific OS.

## Usage

Redis is primarily a key-value store, and it offers a variety of data structures and commands for different use cases. Here are some basic concepts and commands to get you started:

- **Starting Redis Server:** To start the Redis server, open your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  redis-server
  ```

- **Connecting to Redis:** You can connect to a Redis server using the `redis-cli` command:

  ```bash
  redis-cli
  ```

- **Setting a Key-Value Pair:**

  ```bash
  SET mykey "Hello, Redis!"
  ```

- **Retrieving a Value by Key:**

  ```bash
  GET mykey
  ```

- **Working with Lists:**

  ```bash
  LPUSH mylist "item1"
  LPUSH mylist "item2"
  LRANGE mylist 0 -1
  ```

- **Working with Sets:**

  ```bash
  SADD myset "member1"
  SADD myset "member2"
  SMEMBERS myset
  ```

- **Expiring Keys:**

  ```bash
  SETEX mykey 3600 "This key will expire in 1 hour"
  ```

- **Pub/Sub Messaging:**

  Redis supports Publish/Subscribe messaging. You can publish and subscribe to channels for real-time communication.

For a more comprehensive list of commands and features, refer to the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation).

## Configuration

Redis can be configured via a configuration file (`redis.conf`) or by passing command-line arguments to `redis-server`. Configuration options vary depending on your use case. For more information, consult the [official Redis configuration documentation](https://redis.io/topics/config).
